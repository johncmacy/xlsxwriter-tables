# xlsxwriter-tables
Easily export nested data to a 2-dimensional Excel table

This class is intended to be used with [XlsxWriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/working_with_tables.html). It serves two purposes:

1. Co-location of column info and data-generation logic
2. Easily specify deeply nested data as the source for column data

The [example.py](example.py) file shows basic usage; [excel_table.py](excel_table.py) is also thoroughly documented. I intend to document more examples of usage in the future.
